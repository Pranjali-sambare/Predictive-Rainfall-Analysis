Problem Statement

a. Crop yields are heavily influenced by rainfall patterns.

b. Rain impacts delivery efficiency and road safety.

c. Weather affects consumer shopping behavior.

Key Predictions:
a. Linear Regression: How much rainfall will occur tomorrow?

b. Logistic Regression: Will it rain tomorrow? What category does tomorrow's rainfall fall into?



Technologies Used

a. Programming Language: Python üêç

b. Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Tools: Google colab, Kaggle Dataset



Data Preprocessing

a. Dataset Source: Kaggle Dataset

b. Data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature scaling were performed to ensure robust model performance.



Machine Learning Models

a. Linear Regression: Predict rainfall amounts.

b. Logistic Regression: Classify rainfall categories (e.g., no rain, light, moderate, heavy).
